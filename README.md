I came up with this idea of a tournament and wanted to see if it would work, so I built
this single-page web app to test out the idea.

It's built with create-react-app, so you can run `pnpm start` locally for a dev server
or `pnpm build` to build a production bundle.

This is deployed on GitHub Pages at https://drbr.github.io/tournament-simulator.
To deploy, run `pnpm run deploy` locally.
